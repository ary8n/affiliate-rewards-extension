# Privacy Policy (MVP)

This extension stores the following locally:
- Reward points (`chrome.storage.local`)
- User settings (`chrome.storage.sync`): banner enable flag, optional remote data URL

No personal data, browsing history, or product purchase details are transmitted externally in this MVP.

If a remote affiliate data URL is configured by the user, the extension will fetch that JSON anonymously over HTTPS.

Future versions may introduce:
- Authentication & user accounts
- Secure sync of points and redemptions
- Telemetry (opt-in)

Any changes will update this document and require a new version submission.
